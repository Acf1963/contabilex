# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   controlled by the user or UI. However, for an application, it might make sense to include them.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if participants have different OS, dependency resolution
#   might be different.

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
